                <p class="center">Researchers say the results suggest that 30 minutes of exercise a day may provide additional weight loss benefits.
                    For example, people may still have extra energy leftover after shorter workouts to be more physically active throughout the day.
                    In addition, researchers say the men who exercised for 60 minutes a day probably ate more to compensate for the longer workout session and therefore lost less weight.</p>
